# Introduction
This **Privacy Policy** applies to the Discord Server App "**Welcome Editor`#`6464**".

The **Welcome Editor** Server App does not, and will never, collect & store Messages, User Data, or Server Data without explicit notice & consent. Additionally, **Welcome Editor** will never sell or give away the Data that it does store.

The developer of **Welcome Editor** firmly believes in a "we don't want your data keep it away from us" process - thus, **Welcome Editor** will be developed as "stateless" as possible (i.e: without needing to store any information or data at all). If features and functions are not possible to develop "stateless", we will explicitly include them in this Privacy Policy, covering exactly what is needed to be stored, for what purpose, and how that data can be removed from **Welcome Editor** on request.

**Welcome Editor**'s source code is viewable in [**Welcome Editor**'s GitHub Repo](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/WelcomeEditor).

# Use of Locale Data
**Welcome Editor** also makes use of the publicly available locale data (i.e: what language Users and Servers have set) Discord sends to all Server/User Apps using Discord's public API for "Interactions" (e.g: Slash Commands, Context Commands, Select Menus, Buttons, Modals). This locale data is only used for knowing which language **Welcome Editor** should send its responses in, and is NOT stored or tracked in any way.

You can see the public API Documentation regarding what the locale data includes on these official Discord API Documentation Pages:
- [API locale reference](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales)
- [Locale field in Interaction objects](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)
