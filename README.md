# Welcome Editor App
A Server App to allow Discord Servers to edit & toggle the [Welcome Screen feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043913591) again. Hosted using CloudFlare Workers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since Discord favours their [Server Guide feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/13497665141655) over Welcome Screen, you will NOT be able to enable the Welcome Screen in your Server if you also have Server Guide enabled.
> This is a limitation/restriction on Discord's end, so if you want anyone to blame, blame them! Not this App's developer!

> [!WARNING]
> This Server App **requires** the App to have been granted the "**Manage Server**" Permission in order to edit and/or toggle the Welcome Screen in your Server. This is just what the Welcome Screen requires (even for Users) and this App's developer has no control over that requirement. ðŸ™ƒ

# Questions

## Why did you make this App?
> Someone in the [Discord Admins Server](https://dis.gd/dac-faq) really wants Discord to un-deprecate the Welcome Screen feature and allow it to be editible/toggleable in-client again - and brought up a really good use-case/point for why when I discussed this with them.
> 
> Afterwards, it got me thinking and I decided to make this App for that purpose, since the Welcome Screen is still editible & toggleable via the public API. :)
